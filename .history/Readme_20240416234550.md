# Introduction

This is a repository created by myself to save some satisfying themes for Typora. All these themes are found in https://theme.typora.io/.

> The built-in CSS will be replaced after update / reinstall, DO NOT MODIFY THEM.

> - Refer https://support.typora.io/Add-Custom-CSS/ when you want to modify those CSS.
> - Refer https://support.typora.io/About-Themes/ if you want to create / install new themes.
